.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dcmp [OPTION] SRC DEST \f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to compare two files or to recursively compare
files with same relative paths within two different directories.
.PP
dcmp provides functionality similar to a recursive \f[I]cmp(1)\f[].
It reports how many files in two different directories are the same (or
different).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-base
Do a base comparison.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
Prints a list of statistics/timing data for the command.
Files walked, started, completed, seconds, files, bytes read, byte rate,
and file rate.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print the command usage, and the list of options available.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "1." 3
Compare two files in different directories:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcmp /src1/file1 /src2/file2
.IP "2." 3
Compare two directories with verbose output.
The verbose output prints timing and number of bytes read:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcmp \-v /src1 /src2
