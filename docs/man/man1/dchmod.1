.SH NAME
.PP
dchmod \- distributed tool to set permissions and group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dchmod [OPTION] PATH...\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to recursively change permissions and/or group
from a top level directory.
.PP
dchmod provides functionality similar to \f[I]chmod(1)\f[] and
\f[I]chgrp(1)\f[].
Like \f[I]chmod(1)\f[], the tool supports the use of octal or symbolic
mode to change the permissions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input FILE
Read source list from FILE.
FILE must be generated by another tool from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-group GROUP
Change group to specified GROUP name.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode MODE
The mode to apply to each item.
MODE may be octal or symbolic syntax similar to chmod(1).
In symbolic notation, "ugoa" are supported as are "rwxX".
As with chmod, if no leading letter "ugoa" is provided, mode bits are
combined with umask to determine the actual mode.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-exclude REGEX
Do not modify items whose full path matches REGEX, processed by
regexec(3).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-match REGEX
Only modify items whose full path matches REGEX, processed by
regexec(3).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-name
Change \-\-exclude and \-\-match to apply to item name rather than its
full path.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
Prints a list of statistics including the number of files walked, the
number of levels there are in the directory tree, and the number of
files the command operated on, and the files/sec rate for each of those.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print the command usage, and the list of options available.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "1." 3
Use octal mode to change permissions:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dchmod \-\-mode 755 /directory
.IP "2." 3
Set group and mode in a single command using symbolic mode:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dchmod \-\-group mygroup \-\-mode u+r,g+rw /directory
.IP "3." 3
Change permissions to u+rw on all items EXCEPT those whose name match
regex:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dchmod \-\-name \-\-exclude \[aq]afilename\[aq] \-\-mode
u+rw /directory
.PP
Note: You can use \-\-match to change file permissions on all of the
files/directories that match the regex.
