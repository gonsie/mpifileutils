.SH NAME
.PP
dcp \- distributed copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dcp [OPTION] SRC DEST\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.
.PP
dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of \f[I]cp(1)\f[] that evenly
distributes work across a large cluster without any centralized state.
It is designed for copying files that are located on a distributed
parallel file system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input FILE
Read source list from FILE.
FILE must be generated by another tool from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-preserve
Preserve permissions, group, timestamps, and extended attributes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-synchronous
Use synchronous read/write calls (open files with 0_DIRECT)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sparse
Create sparse files when possible (non\-functioning).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief message listing the \f[I]dcp(1)\f[] options and usage.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
If a long\-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning.
One may use drm to quickly remove a partial copy of a large directory
tree.
.PP
To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the \-s
option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "1." 3
To copy dir1 as dir2:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2
.IP "2." 3
To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:
.PP
mkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1/* /dest/dir2
.IP "3." 3
To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and attributes:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcp \-p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2
.SH KNOWN BUGS
.PP
Using the \-S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL.
If you try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.
.PP
The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters.
This may be less than the number of characters that your operating
system supports.
